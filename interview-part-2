Describe how you would thoroughly test the "https://www.nba.com/watch/nba-tv" page below:
nba-tv : "https://www.nba.com/watch/nba-tv"

Summary: 
It appears that the main functionality on this page is to allow the user live access to nba-tv. 
I would start by having automated tests that check that each header label exists for each section of the page. 
Additionally, would likely automate accessing the live stream with and without a subscription/tv provider.
 
Finally, below are some workflows that I think would be critical flows to test. 

// accessing live stream without subscription or tv provider
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user does not have a subscription to nba-tv or a tv provider
Then the live stream can't be accessed

// accessing live stream with subscription or tv provider
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user does have a subscription to nba-tv or a tv provider
Then the live stream CAN be accessed

// accessing live stream schedule
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user clicks on See Full Schedule
Then the user is presented with the available nba-tv schedule
And the user can see other NBA TV Clips

// accessing OTHER media without subscription (i.e FEATURED EPISODES)
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When navigate to available media other than the live stream
Then the media content CAN be accessed

// accessing NBA FINALS 
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user navigates to the NBA FINALS section of the page
Then the user is presented with past, in-order finals media

// accessing live stream from various devices
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user starts the live stream via browser from multiple devices,
Then the live stream plays successfully

//all hyperlinks are functional
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user  clicks on any available hyperlink
Then user is redirected to the appropiate page

// page responsive design
Given that user navigates to nba-tv
When user starts the live stream from multiple devices,
Then the page resizes according to the device
